NOTE: If your BlueSCSI was shipped after April 3rd, 2021 please refer to the 1.0-c troubleshooting guide.

## Green LED Flashes on and off

This indicates BlueSCSI could not find any files on the SD card or communicate with the SD card.

Ensure your files are named properly (case sensitive) following the naming convetion in the readme.

If you recived a kit - verify all connections and that the outside of the SD holder is grounded.

## LOG.txt is empty

This indicates the BlueSCSI could communicate with the SD Card but found no files. Check your naming convention.

## Slow performance

Ensure you are using a good SD card. SD card quality can vary widely. 

Format your card as ExFat - users have seen quite a jump in performance.
