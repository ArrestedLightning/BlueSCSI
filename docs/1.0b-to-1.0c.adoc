# BlueSCSI 1.0-b to 1.0-c
:toc: macro

## Introduction

1.0-c was a small change to fix an issue with machines that provide low or no `TERMPOWER` over the SCSI bus. If you recived a Fully Assembled BlueSCSI after April 1st, 2021 then this was done for you. If you have a kit labled 1.0-b you can make these modifications to become a 1.0-c.

## Steps

### Disconnect `TERMPOWER` from 220 Pull Up Jupmer

Use a cutting tool to cut the small trace between the `TERMPOWR` and 220 Pull Up Jumper pictured below.

Make sure continiutiy from `TERMPOWER` to the diode still flows correctly but is disconnected from the jumper.

### Connect 5V to 220 Pull Up Jupmer

Now we will provide pull up from the 5v provided by the BluePill.
